## Build Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Android Studio with Wear OS emulator
- Node.js 16+ and npm
- Java 17+
- Wear OS device (optional, for testing)

### Build Commands

1. **Build Web Assets for Wear OS**:
   ```bash
   npm run build:wear
   ```

2. **Sync Capacitor**:
   ```bash
   npm run sync:wear
   ```

3. **Build Wear OS APK**:
   ```bash
   cd android/wear
   ./gradlew assembleDebug
   ```

4. **Install on Device**:
   ```bash
   adb -s <watch_device> install app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
   ```

### Development Workflow

1. **Start Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev

- **Simplified History**: Last 10 transactions only
- **No Lightning Invoices**: Receive only, no invoice creation
- **Minimal Settings**: Basic settings only

### Platform Limitations
- **Wear OS 3.0+**: Requires modern Wear OS devices
- **Bluetooth Range**: Limited to ~10m for mesh networking
- **Internet Dependency**: Requires internet for Nostr/mint access

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build Errors**:
   - Ensure Wear OS dependencies are properly configured
   - Check Android SDK versions match requirements
   - Verify Capacitor configuration

2. **Bluetooth Issues**:
   - Check Bluetooth permissions
   - Verify device supports BLE
   - Test with different Wear OS devices

3. **Battery Drain**:
   - Check battery optimization settings
   - Monitor Bluetooth scan intervals
   - Test ambient mode functionality

4. **UI Issues**:
   - Verify CSS responsive breakpoints
   - Test on different screen sizes
   - Check touch target sizes

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Monitor logs
adb logcat | grep "BitpointsWear"

# Check Bluetooth status
adb shell dumpsys bluetooth_manager

# Monitor battery usage
adb shell dumpsys batterystats

# Test ambient mode
adb shell am broadcast -a android.intent.action.SCREEN_OFF
```

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Native Compose UI**: Replace WebView with native Compose
- **Advanced Complications**: More watch face integration
- **Voice Commands**: Voice-activated token transfers
- **Gesture Controls**: Rotary input for navigation
- **Offline Mode**: Full offline operation capability

### Performance Optimizations
- **Bluetooth Mesh Optimization**: Reduce power consumption
- **UI Rendering**: Improve Compose performance
- **Memory Management**: Optimize for watch constraints
- **Background Processing**: Better background task handling
