# iOS Bluetooth Plugin Implementation - Status Report

**Tag:** `v1.3.0-ios-bluetooth-partial`  
**Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Status:** Partial Implementation - Plugin Not Loading

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive summary of the iOS Bluetooth mesh networking implementation for the Bitpoints.me app. The implementation is based on the `bitchat` project's Bluetooth approach and includes full CoreBluetooth integration with Capacitor plugin bridge.

## What Has Been Completed ‚úÖ

### 1. Core Bluetooth Implementation
- **`ios/App/App/Services/BLEService.swift`**: Complete CoreBluetooth implementation
  - CBCentralManager and CBPeripheralManager integration
  - Background queue processing
  - Maintenance timer for periodic tasks
  - Comprehensive delegate methods
  - State management and error handling

- **`ios/App/App/Services/TransportConfig.swift`**: Centralized configuration
  - Service UUIDs and characteristics
  - Timing and connection parameters
  - Mesh networking constants

- **`ios/App/App/Services/BluetoothEcashService.swift`**: High-level service wrapper
  - Mesh networking logic
  - Message routing and peer discovery
  - Token transfer functionality
  - Noise encryption service integration

### 2. Capacitor Plugin Integration
- **`ios/App/App/Plugins/BluetoothEcashPlugin/BluetoothEcashPlugin.swift`**: Native plugin
  - All required plugin methods implemented
  - Proper CAPPlugin inheritance
  - Comprehensive logging with üîµ emoji markers
  - Delegate pattern for event handling

- **`ios/App/App/Plugins/BluetoothEcashPlugin/BluetoothEcashPlugin.m`**: Objective-C bridge
  - Method registration with Capacitor
  - All plugin methods properly exposed

### 3. iOS Configuration
- **`ios/App/App/Info.plist`**: Proper permissions
  - NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription
  - NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription
  - NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription
  - NSBonjourServices
  - UIBackgroundModes (bluetooth-central, bluetooth-peripheral)

### 4. Plugin Package Structure
- **`plugins/bluetooth-ecash/`**: Capacitor plugin package
  - Proper package.json configuration
  - TypeScript definitions
  - iOS source integration
  - Installed via npm

### 5. Frontend Integration
- **`src/plugins/bluetooth-ecash.ts`**: Updated to use installed plugin
- **`src/stores/bluetooth.ts`**: Bluetooth store with mesh networking
- Plugin properly imported and used in frontend

### 6. Build Process Fixes
- Plugin files no longer deleted during build
- Proper file copying and preservation
- Successful build process

## Current Issues ‚ùå

### Primary Problem: Plugin Not Loading
Despite all components being in place, the plugin is not executing:

1. **No Blue Circle Logs**: No üîµ emoji logs appearing in console
2. **No Frontend Registration**: Plugin registration logs not appearing
3. **No Method Calls**: Native plugin methods not being invoked
4. **Silent Failure**: No error messages or exceptions

### Technical Details
- Plugin files are present in built app: `/App.app/public/plugins/bluetooth-ecash/src/index.js`
- Native Swift code compiles without errors
- Capacitor plugin package is installed
- Build process completes successfully
- App launches without crashes

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue appears to be in the **Capacitor plugin registration process**. While we have:
- ‚úÖ Native Swift plugin code
- ‚úÖ Plugin package structure
- ‚úÖ Frontend integration
- ‚úÖ Build process working

We're missing the **bridge between Capacitor and our native plugin**. The plugin package exists but Capacitor cannot discover or load the native iOS implementation.

## Testing Commands Used

```bash
# Build and test
cd ios/App && xcodebuild -workspace App.xcworkspace -scheme App -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17' build

# Install and launch
xcrun simctl install "iPhone 17" "/path/to/App.app"
xcrun simctl launch "iPhone 17" me.bitpoints.wallet

# Monitor logs
xcrun simctl spawn "iPhone 17" log show --last 1m --predicate 'eventMessage CONTAINS "üîµ"' --style compact
```

## Next Steps for Next Agent üéØ

### Immediate Priority
1. **Debug Capacitor Plugin Registration**
   - Investigate why Capacitor cannot discover the native plugin
   - Check plugin discovery mechanism
   - Verify plugin loading process

2. **Test Plugin Method Calls**
   - Add more diagnostic logging
   - Test individual plugin methods
   - Verify frontend-to-native communication

3. **Capacitor Bridge Investigation**
   - Check if plugin is properly registered with Capacitor
   - Verify plugin method mapping
   - Test plugin initialization

### Technical Approaches to Try
1. **Plugin Registration Debugging**
   ```bash
   # Check if plugin is discovered
   npx cap doctor
   npx cap sync ios --verbose
   ```

2. **Native Plugin Testing**
   - Add more logging to plugin initialization
   - Test plugin methods directly
   - Verify Capacitor plugin discovery

3. **Alternative Approaches**
   - Consider direct native integration (bypass Capacitor)
   - Use Capacitor's plugin generator
   - Check plugin package structure

### Key Files to Focus On
- `ios/App/App/Plugins/BluetoothEcashPlugin/BluetoothEcashPlugin.swift`
- `plugins/bluetooth-ecash/src/index.js`
- `src/plugins/bluetooth-ecash.ts`
- Capacitor plugin registration process

## Environment Details
- **Platform**: iOS Simulator (iPhone 17)
- **Xcode**: Version 17A400
- **Capacitor**: Latest version
- **Swift**: Latest version
- **Build Target**: iOS 13.0+

## Success Criteria for Next Agent
- [ ] Blue circle logs (üîµ) appearing in console
- [ ] Frontend plugin registration logs visible
- [ ] Native plugin methods being called
- [ ] Bluetooth service initializing properly
- [ ] Plugin working end-to-end

## Notes
- The implementation is comprehensive and follows best practices
- All native code is properly implemented
- The issue is specifically with Capacitor plugin loading
- No crashes or build errors
- Plugin files are present in the correct locations

The next agent should focus on debugging the Capacitor plugin registration process rather than implementing new features. The foundation is solid and just needs the bridge connection to be established.
